# MSc Applied Data Science and Statistics Final Project - Bayesian Estimation for Airborne Hygrometry

All code in this project has been written using R version 3.6.1 (R Core Team 2019), and the relevant code required to reproduce the figures in the final report are available here. These also include the final .Rmd and the forward filtering R code for univariate DLMs. The two datasets required are available for download here ([c007_dv.mat](https://www.dropbox.com/s/exxjkegr9a2awyq/c007_dv.mat?dl=0) and [b878_dv.mat](https://www.dropbox.com/s/h878lrkxppuvrs1/b878_dv.mat?dl=0)).
